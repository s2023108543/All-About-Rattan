    <h1>All About Rattan</h1>
</div>

<p class="rattan">
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.9cbcc0a3393e736b0109f740bc25eb36?rik=egy2xAHzJzk%2fSg&riu=http%3a%2f%2f1.bp.blogspot.com%2f-u7xH_6R_74o%2fTyQAmEyeydI%2fAAAAAAAAAAw%2fpXYFe5o7YLI%2fs1600%2fRattan_rattansupplies.blogspot.com.jpg&ehk=ktFnOjK%2fzNkOhB2nai48F2eVw0QEIW%2bk0N7A7gZ4S70%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" style="width:510px;height:510px;margin-right:50px;vertical-align: middle;"> Rattan is a flowering plant in the palm family, mainly found in Southeast Asia and other parts of Africa. Its resilience, portability, and waterproofness make it extremely valuable. It is widely used in making furniture, handicrafts, and even in construction. Thanks to its strength and ability to withstand various weather conditions, rattan is a great choice for outdoor furniture like dining chairs, sofas, and lounge chairs. 
</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Where does rattan came from?</h2>
    <p>
         Southeast Asia is home to a wide range of rattan species, which are primarily tropical in nature. The major rattan-producing nations are Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia where almost 70% of the world's supply comes from Indonesia alone, making it the primary supplier. In the extensive tropical woods of these nations, rattan, a climbing palm, is widely distributed. Due to its ideal growing circumstances and traditional farming methods, Southeast Asia continues to be the primary region for rattan production, despite the fact that rattan is also found in some parts of Africa and Australasia. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>How is rattan furniture made?</h2>
    <p>
        Harvesting the rattan cane from the forests is the first step in creating rattan furniture. The canes are cleaned and dried after harvest. In order to make "cane," the outer skin, or rind, is frequently peeled off, while the inner core is utilized for a variety of reasons. To increase their endurance and guard against insect damage, the canes are occasionally cooked in oil or treated with chemicals. Depending on the furniture design, the processed rattan canes are either used whole or divided into smaller strips. After that, these parts are sculpted and bent, frequently with the help of steam to increase their pliability.
     For furniture frames, artisans mold the rattan into the appropriate forms using a variety of techniques. The formed pieces are put together using screws, nails, or binding materials like leather or twine to create furniture components like chairs, tables, and couches. The furniture is then painted or stained to get the desired finish after any sharp edges are smoothed out with sanding. For added longevity and a glossy appearance, a protective coating is frequently applied.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Rattan Crafts</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond furniture, rattan is also used to make a wide range of beautiful and functional crafts. Items such as baskets, lampshades, and storage containers can all be crafted from rattan. These handmade crafts add a unique, rustic touch to any home or space, highlighting the natural beauty and flexibility of the material. Rattan crafts are often used to create eco-friendly, one-of-a-kind home décor.
